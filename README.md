# Project Background
Elist Electronics, established in 2018, is a global e-commerce company that sells popular electronic products worldwide via its website and mobile app. 

The company has significant amounts of data on its sales, marketing efforts, operational efficiency, product offerings, and loyalty program that has been previously underutilized.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Sales Trends Analysis:** Evaluation of historical sales patterns, both globally and by region, focusing on Revenue, Order Volume, and Average Order Value (AOV).
- **Product Level Performance:** An analysis of Elist's various product lines, understanding their impact on sales and returns 
- **Loyalty Program Success:** An assessment of the loyalty program on customer retention and sales
- **Operational Efficiency:** An evaluation of logistical effectiveness, including processing and shipping times
- **Sales and Marketing Channels:** An investigation into the success of Elist's various sales and marketing channels

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

After peaking in late 2020, the company's sales have continued to decline, with significant drops in 2022. Key performance indicators have all shown year-over-year decreases: order volume by 40%, revenue by 46%, and average order value (AOV) by 10%. While this decline can be broadly attributed to a return to pre-pandemic normalcy, the following sections will explore additional contributing factors and highlight key opportunity areas for improvement.
