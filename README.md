# Project Background
Elist Electronics, established in 2018, is a global e-commerce company that sells popular electronic products worldwide via its website and mobile app. 

The company has significant amounts of data on its sales, marketing efforts, operational efficiency, product offerings, and loyalty program that has been previously underutilized. This project thoroughly analyzes and synthesizes this data in order to uncover critical insights that will improve Elist's commercial success. 

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Sales Trends Analysis:** Evaluation of historical sales patterns, both globally and by region, focusing on Revenue, Order Volume, and Average Order Value (AOV).
- **Product Level Performance:** An analysis of Elist's various product lines, understanding their impact on sales and returns 
- **Loyalty Program Success:** An assessment of the loyalty program on customer retention and sales
- **Operational Efficiency:** An evaluation of logistical effectiveness, including processing and shipping times
- **Sales and Marketing Channels:** An investigation into the success of Elist's various sales and marketing channels 

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Elist Electronics processed over 108,000 orders from 2019 to 2022, totaling approximately $28 million in sales with an average order value of $260. A significant portion of this growth is likely due to the surge in consumer spending during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in 2022, sales performance declined by 46% compared to 2021. By analyzing the data in depth, we aim to uncover trends and identify strategies to mitigate losses and explore new opportunities for growth.
